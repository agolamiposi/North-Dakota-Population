# North-Dakota-Population
North Dakota Population Prediction
Analysis of North Dakota Population using Machine Learning and artifial intelligence
All analysis was done by Olamiposi Agboola.
The datasets and Jupyter notebook used in the project is also included in this repository.

Introduction
This project was born out of curiousity due to an increasing population in North Dakota. I retrieved data set from ND state data center. The data set shows population for all cities in North dakota for Census 2000, 2010 and 2020. I used machine learning and artigial intelligence to to predict the population of north Dakota for 2025 and 2030 and confirm if there is going to be a rapid increase in population.

Methodology

Python Libraries
The libraries used on this project include:
Pandas –for data manipulation and analysis
Numpy – For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations
Scikit learn – For Machine learning tasks
Matplotlib: for creating various types of plots and visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots.
Seaborn:for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. 
TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library. for building neural networks and other machine learning models.
Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow Keras allows you to define neural network architectures using simple and intuitive building blocks.

Conclusion
There is a projected rapid increase in population for at least 75% of the top 20 major cities in North Dakota.
Fargo, West Fargo and Horace are expected to see huge increase in population form 2020 to 2025 and also 2025 to 2030.
Bismarck, Williston, Dickinson, Mandan and Watford city would see decrease in population in 2025
